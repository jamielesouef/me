# Digital Resume iOS App

A simple, clean, and open source **digital resume** iOS app written in Swift 6. This project serves as a demonstration of modern iOS development techniques using **SwiftUI**, **Swift Data**, **Swift concurrency**, **networking**, and other native features — all wrapped in a minimal, elegant design inspired by the principles of Dieter Rams.

The goal is to provide potential employers or companies with a seamless way to explore my professional background, skills, and experience through an app that is both visually appealing and technically up-to-date.
